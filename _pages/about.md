I am currently a Research Statistician Developer at [SAS](https://www.sas.com/en_us/home.html). My primary responsibility is to implement new statistical functions as part of SAS IML (Interactive Matrix Language) software. I also write technical documentation, develop tests, and respond to technical questions from users.

Previously, I completed a PhD in biostatistics at [UNC-CH](https://sph.unc.edu/bios), under the guidance of [Dr. Clarice Weinberg](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/atniehs/labs/bb/staff/weinberg/index.cfm) in the [Biostatistics and Computational Biology Branch](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/atniehs/labs/bb/index.cfm) of the [National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/). My dissertation focused on methods to mine high-dimensional genetic data for higher-order gene-gene and gene-environment interactions using evolutionary computation. 

Prior to UNC-CH, I graduated from [Grinnell College](https://www.grinnell.edu/) in 2012 with a B.A. in Biology, and I earned a master's degree in epidemiology and biostatistics in 2015 from [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/). While at Northwestern, I also worked as a statistical analyst in the [Department of Preventive Medicine](https://www.preventivemedicine.northwestern.edu/) and as a clinical research associate in the [Department of Dermatology](https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/sites/dermatology/).
