I am currently a PhD student in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://sph.unc.edu/bios/) at the [Gillings School of Global Public Health](https://sph.unc.edu/) at UNC-CH. I am completing my dissertation research with [Dr. Clarice Weinberg](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/atniehs/labs/bb/staff/weinberg/index.cfm) in the [Biostatistics and Computational Biology Branch](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/atniehs/labs/bb/index.cfm) of the [National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/) through the [NIH Intramural Research Program](https://www.training.nih.gov/). My research focuses on developing methods to mine high-dimensional genetic data for higher-order gene-gene and gene-environment interactions using evolutionary computation. 

Previously, I graduated from [Grinnell College](https://www.grinnell.edu/) in 2012 with a B.A. in Biology, and I earned a master's degree in Epidemiology and Biostatistics in 2015 from [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/). While at Northwestern, I also worked as a statistical analyst in the [Department of Preventive Medicine](https://www.preventivemedicine.northwestern.edu/) and as a clinical research associate in the [Department of Dermatology](https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/sites/dermatology/).
